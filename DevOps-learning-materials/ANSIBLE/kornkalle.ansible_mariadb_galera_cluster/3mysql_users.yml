Summary:-This play basically sets the user privilages based on their existence.

- `append_privs`: Determines whether to add or replace privileges for an existing user.
- `with_subelements`: A loop construct to iterate over a list of dictionaries and their sub-elements.
- `state`: Specifies whether the MySQL user should be present or absent.

We also provided an example and explained how `append_privs` works in combination with the loop, allowing you to accumulate or replace privileges for a MySQL user on different hosts.

Additionally, we covered the significance of the `state` parameter in the context of managing MySQL users with Ansible. The `state: present` ensures the user's presence with specified configurations, while `state: absent` removes the user if it exists.

Overall, the Ansible play is designed to be flexible, allowing you to manage MySQL users on multiple hosts with varying privileges and states.
